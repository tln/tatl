{pos ?= {}}
<p>From now on we'll ignore common. Lets introduce placeholders. We want to put some content at the top to the page (the chide) that we calculate later. Of course, this could be solved in other ways! But it's a good introduction point.</p>

<ul>
<li> Placeholders make a function. 
<li> When called, they put the parameter back where the placeholder was created.
<li> Star placeholders return their argument so they can be inlined. 
</ul>

Note that the inlined call is the same as a filter. Also, if there are multiple expressions in a
substitution, only the last one is emitted.

<p>Lets introduce <a href="#{pos.next.counter}">{pos.next.value.title ?: "this"}</a> next.
