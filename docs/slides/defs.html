<h1>Calls, defs</h1>

<p>This is getting complicated. Lets move out some of the pieces using macros.
The second file is called <code>common.html</code>, and would be compiled into a module called <code>common</code>; we can access the macros within that module by using <code>common::name</code>.

<p>The <code>def=</code> tag defines a macro. Note that we moved the <code>{{labels = {{..}}}}</code> inside the macro.
When it was outside the macro, it was a local var of the implicit html macro. Macros can 
only access parameters that are passed in.

<p>We call a local function via <code>{{function()}}</code> and function from another template via <code>{{template::function()}}</code>
