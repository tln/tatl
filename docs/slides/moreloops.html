More data, more loops. 

Ok, we need labels for the radio buttons. Lets add set a local variable. Then we look up the number.
If its not found, then nothing is inserted -- expression paths don't fail on missing values.

Lets add another tag: set="". This will take the tag, after execution of the for, if etc, and
set a local variable. Theres also a filter -- set="" requires |tag or |contents.

For the sake of a scenario, lets say we've decided to nag people about 
their number in the footer, too; we're referencing our variable like it was passed in.

<html>
	<h1>Hello {name}<h1>
	<p set="chide|tag" if>
		Your emergency contact number is: {number}
		<else>
		Please set an emergency contact number!
	</p>
	
	<li>
		<ul class="{.level}" for="notices">{.text}
			<div class="more-info" if>
				<a href="{.url}">Additional information</a>
			</div>
		<ul>
	</li>
	
	{labels = {1: "(Needs work)", 5: "(Fantastic)"}; }
	<form>
		Rate our service!
		<do for="5...1">
			<input type="radio" name="rating" value="{.}"> {.} {labels[.]}
		</do>
	</form>
