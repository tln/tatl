Ok, now lets look at the special *tags*. Just two: <do> acts like any other tag but doesn't show up in the output.

We're using it to loop, where the looped contents don't all go in the same tag (it happens).

<else> works with if=. <else if=""> would do what you expect too.
	
Also, notice we're looping over a list of numbers now, and we're just writing that list in here directly.
