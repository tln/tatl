<h1>Filters</h1>

<p>Expressions can have filters, to alter the output quoting.
    
<p>Functions can also have filters, eg for caching. (No function level filters are currently provided!).
Its usually better to use a return expression.
     
<p>Note that the * is picking up <code>name</code> as a parameter -- free variables
(eg, not a <code>param<code> target, assigment, or loop iteration variable) will be
added automatically.
