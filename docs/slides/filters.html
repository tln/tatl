<h1>Filters</h1>

<p>Expressions can have filters, to alter the output quoting. In example 1, <code>{greeting|trim}<code> will output the greeting after trimming the excess spaces.

<p>Functions can also have function filters (similar to Python decorators). In example 2, a function named <code>fn</code> is defined that will also remove extra whitespaceGenerally the builtin filters will support being used as function filters or expression filters.

<p>Note that the * is picking up <code>name</code> as a parameter -- free variables
(eg, not a <code>param</code> target, assigment, or loop iteration variable) will be
added automatically.

<p>Example 3 is a function expression, which is usually preferable to a function filter where both could be used. Function filters are better used for behaviors like caching that change how a function behaves.
