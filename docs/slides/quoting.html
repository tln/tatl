Quoting and content

Content is automatically quoted according to position within the document.

Doubled braces inserts one brace, and does not start a substitution. A brace just before a tag also inserts 
the brace without being a substitution.

Nothing in the <style> or <script> is substituted.

<html>
	{{ }}
	
	{<tt>test</tt>}

	<a onclick="alert('Hello {name}')">Hello!</a>
	
	<a href="http://www.example.com/{urlpart}?n={parameter}">Hello!</a>
	
	<style>
	Nothing in here is {substituted}
	</style>
	
	<script>
	Nothing in here is {substituted}
	</script>
	
</html>
