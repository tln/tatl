Comments and front matter.

Comments are NOT processed or sent with the document.

Comments with a square bracket as the first character ie, <!--[ --> ARE sent.
Without this rule, the "conditional comments" that older versions of IE used would
not be sent causing pain.

Comments with a brace as the first character are front matter, or metadata about the template.
You could store docs, copyright info, etc in here.

Front matter must be JSON to ensure maximum interoperability. That means the keys 
must use quotes unlike maps in this templating language or objects in Javascript.

<!--{"key": "value"}-->
<!-- comment - not even sent with document-->
<![CDATA[]]>
<html>
<!--{ ...front matter for html macro... }-->
<!--[ comment that is sent ]-->
<!-- comment not sent -->
<!--- No {substitution in comments} -->

	<do def="foo()">
		<!--{front matter for foo}-->
	</do>
</html>
